According to Marshall McLuhan's text, a hot medium is one that extends one single sense in high definition. Hot media is low in participation. On the other hand, cool media is high in participation.    

For example, a movie could be considered a good representation of a hot media, because it does not involve much participation. We are most likely sitting down and simply watching and taking in all that we are seeing.   
A TV in comparison could be considered a cool media. If referring to a cartoon specifially, it would be considered a cool media because it provides little visual information. A TV can also bring people together to watch sports and this invites the viewers to celebrate and generate possible diologue between eachother.
