According to Barthes, there are three types of messages, linguistic message, coded iconic message, and non-coded iconic message that make an advertising image intentional and meaningful.  
The image I chose is the image that Gucci debuted its SS18 collection. If seen this image else where instead of a large billboard or showcased in a window display, we might have seen this image differently, it is true it has some elements that are reminiscent of older paintings, and I believe was exactly what Gucci was going for here. 
While the Panzani image we analyzed in class wanted to reveal a sense of “Italiancity” to the consumers, the Gucci collection is telling the consumers that by wearing gucci they are in a painting like dream.by using messages such as shining dust, water lilies and the fact that they used a painting not a simple photograph.
