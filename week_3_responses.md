# The Total Artwork 
Through the advancements of technology, it has been made more feasible to pursue Gesamtkunstwer, the synthesis of multiple art forms into a unified whole. This is what Wagner originally intended. There was emphasis on attempting to elevate the arts by making the experience engaging to spectators by provoking a sensual or emotional impact.     


Space and Movement became a significant and huge factor in making this possible, these elements were said to be as important as the voice and scenic atmosphere in the creation of worlds.  
This required design and architectural knowledge and as this progressed so did the fusion of art and engineering.  
Performance art acquired so many different elements and the stage was turned into a machine, through the use of screens, moving parts, projections and a complex use of lighting.
