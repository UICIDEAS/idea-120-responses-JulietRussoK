In "The Mandalorian," the actors perform against a backdrop of LED screens displaying virtual backgrounds in real-time.   
This technology, known as StageCraft, creates backgrounds that react to camera movements, allowing for smooth incorporation of live-action performances with digital scenery.  

There are several realities described in the article, but there is the physical reality. This layer refers to the tangible, real-world environment where the actors perform. There is the Virtual Reality for Actors, where the LED screens surrounding the set immerse the actors in virtual environment. There is the Virtual Reality for Viewers and this the virtual environments displayed in the show appear seamlessly integrated with the live-action footage, blurring the line between physical and virtual reality. Finally there is the narrative reality. The story the plot and characters are real for both the viewer and the actors.
